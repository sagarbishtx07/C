        As you might have read in the bottom navigation plate that this zone is for code but since we have only done the introduction

        What you seen in the above program is called type casting. Here b an floating point or a decimal value
         has been converted/printed as an integer values by the use of type cast or using it as an integer by simply
         adding (int) before it. It can be done vice versa or in other words you can print an int a=10; as 10.0000
        using type casting to float i.e. \'(float)a\'; ;
